// generators simplify iterator-authoring using function* and yield.
// A function declared as function* returns a Generator instance.
// Generators are subtypes of iterators which include additional next and throw.
// These enable values to flow back into the generator, so yield is an expression form which returns a value (or throws)
// Can also be used to enable 'await'-like async programming.
